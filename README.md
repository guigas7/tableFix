# tableFix

From a base table in the same directory, called 'input.csv', for all questionaries in quests, finds the columns for the labels of each questionaries and repeats their columns for every new line of repeated column 0 entry, acording to the 'days' list. For every repeated entry, deletes them, while passing their data from questionaries in quest to the newly created columns, in the line of the original entry (second line to first new column range, third line to second new column range, and so on, taking from the repeated lines, to the first of that entry). The columns from post list will be copied from the last repeated line of each entry (checking by col 0) to the same columns in the line of the original entry. After the data is all copied to the first line of each unique entry in col 0, all repeated lines will be removed.
